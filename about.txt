Wouldn't it be great if the World-Wide Web were simple?

See that image there?  That's me taking a selfie on top of Mount Monadnock in Jaffrey, NH.  We started hiking that day thinking it would be a regular hike...but wouldn't it be great if everything were that simple? ...can you see a theme developing here...?

My family hikes this mountain regularly, okay.  The mountian is about a 2 hour drive for us, so we start out early in the morning; me, my 5 kids, and my wife, and sometimes others. We find a place to park, usually hit the bathrooms, grab our packs and then hike our way up to the top. 

side Note - Mt. Monadnock peaks at about 3150ft. above sea level. The hike is a little more than 2 miles one-way. The elevation gain from the trail head is about 1800ft. And the view from the top is very impressive!

Once we get there and we've had time to take in the amazing view, we usually stop and enjoy an extended lunch break at the peak before hiking our way back down. The hike down always seems to take longer than we expect, so we're pretty tired once getting back to the trail head. As you can imagine, this is an all day affair for us. Nothing crazy, just ...long. But, the day I took that selfie was apparently no regular day.  

We started out with the notion that the temp was going to be pretty warm so we brought plenty of water and dressed for warm weather, but of course we were prepared for anything.  About half-way up the mountain some wind rolled in that caused a sudden and tremendous drop in temperature.  Most of us decided to stop and pull a sweatshirt from our packs to try and warm up a little.  After a while we got back into some tree cover so the wind wasn't so bad, but then the clouds rolled in and started to rain on us.  Rain in the warm weather isn't usually bad, but this day was really cold now because of the wind. So, now here we all are wet and cold.  Some of our crew whined and pleaded to turn back, but I was determined not to let a little weather get in the way. (possible block quote ) See I believe in finishing what you start and I wasn't about to turn back just because of being uncomfortable.  I mean sure, I was cold, and wet, and that part wasn't very fun, but I just couldn't let the mountain get the best of me. Something in me just screamed, "We don't give up, we overcome." So we continued in spite of the conditions.
