Wouldn't it be great if the World-Wide Web were simple?

See that image there?  That's me taking a selfie on top of Mount Monadnock in Jaffrey, NH.  We started hiking that day thinking it would be a regular hike...but wouldn't it be great if everything were that simple? ...can you see a theme developing here...?

My family hikes this mountain regularly, okay.  The mountian is about a 2 hour drive for us, so we start out early in the morning; me, my 5 kids, and my wife, and sometimes others. We find a place to park, usually hit the bathrooms, grab our packs and then hike our way up to the top. 

side Note - Mt. Monadnock peaks at about 3150ft. above sea level. The hike is a little more than 2 miles one-way. The elevation gain from the trail head is about 1800ft. And the view from the top is very impressive!

Once we get there and we've had time to take in the amazing view, we usually stop and enjoy an extended lunch break at the peak before hiking our way back down. The hike down always seems to take longer than we expect, so we're pretty tired once getting back to the trail head. As you can imagine, this is an all day affair for us. Nothing crazy, just ...long. But, the day I took that selfie was apparently no regular day.  

We started out with the understanding that the temperature was going to be pretty warm so we brought plenty of water and dressed for warm weather, but of course we were prepared for anything.  About half-way up the mountain some wind rolled in that caused a sudden and tremendous drop in temperature.  In fact, it got so cold that most of us decided to stop and pull a sweatshirt from our packs to try and warm up a little.  After a while we got back into some tree cover so the wind wasn't so bad, but then the clouds rolled in and started to rain on us.  Rain in the warm weather isn't usually bad, but this day had turned really cold now because of the wind. So, now here we all are wet and cold, hiking up the trail, in and out of tree cover.  Some of our crew whined and pleaded to turn back, but I was determined not to let a little weather get in the way. (possible block quote ) See I believe in finishing what you start and I wasn't about to turn back just because of being uncomfortable.  I mean sure, I was cold, and I was wet, and that part wasn't very fun, but I just couldn't let the mountain get the best of me. Something in me just screamed, "We don't give up, we overcome." So we continued in spite of the conditions. 

Let me rewind a bit - About two days before this trip, I was working up on a roof and pulled my hip muscle pretty hard.  It was uncomfortable to walk and I probably should have cancelled the trip, but like I said, I'm not about letting circumstances get the best of me. Looking back, I defintely should have postponed the trip.  I was in no physical shape to be hiking...  

We obviously made it to the top as you can see from the picture.  The summit was soooo windy, which made it cold and very difficult to have our picnic.  Mostly everyone just wanted the day to be over.  But not me.  I had to take a selfie and get some footage of the view.  I ate quickly so that I could go around and get some pics without holding everyone else up.  The pain in my hip and the cold on my skin reminded me this is what we came up for afterall, isn't it?  To overcome the mountain.  I mean sure, we could all look at the beautiful site from the ground and that would be great, but the personal satisfaction I get from hiking up a mountain is ...indescribable.  Up there... on the mountain... life just seems so... simple!

So to bring this back to my point...

Our trip up (and down) the mountain that day was anything but simple.  But the personal satisfaction I experienced while being at the summit, that was simple.  The reality is that life is rarely simple and the world-wide-web is anything but simple, but as the key person in your organization, your involvement with the web needs to be simple.  Afterall, you've got plenty of other things that you need to be dealing with.  That's what got me started in web development.  

I was an entrepreneur who needed some help with web stuff.  I didn't know anything about how to build a webpage but I had heard whispers of just how simple it could be to establish my online presence.  I learned how to use webpage builders and tried to DIY my way in.  Then I attempted to hire some help and get a website created for me.  I hired people to help with marketing and SEO.  But, everyone I recruited to help me seemed to come up short.  I've dealt with all kinds of "website people" who claimed to know what they were doing. All of which were happy to continue taking my money while providing me no new business.  Sure, having a website is great, but I needed to make money.  So I studied.  I researched marketing, and sales, and SEO, and web design.  My studies (and some life circumstances) eventually led me to learn web development which kind of gave me a space to put it all together.  I guess I felt like, "If I can't find someone who can actually help me, I'll just learn it myself."  

You're reading this right now because it occurs to me that I'm not alone.  I know there are many people just like you who need a source for real help.  The kind of help that I can actually offer.  Real help that produces real results.  That's what I'm about.  Real results.  If there's a challenge, let's overcome it!  And as an entrepreneur myself, I know that your website needs to bring you $2 for every dollar spent on it.  You can't afford to keep paying me unless I can deliver on that promise.
