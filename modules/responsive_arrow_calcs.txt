First, solve for "a" to get the long side of the triangle

(a * a) = (b * b) + (c * c) - 2bc cos(A)

a = long side
b = opposite side
c = adjacent side
A = angle between b and c

----------------------------------------------------------

Now use law of sines to find the angle "B" facing the opposite side

sin(B) / b = sin(A) / a

B = angle facing short side
b = length of short side
A = angle between b and c
a = long side of the triangle
